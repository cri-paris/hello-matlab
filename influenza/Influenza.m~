    %INFLUENZA Summary of this class goes here
    %   1. A first kind of graph we want to extract from these data would show us, for a given time point
    % (parameter), what is the mortality by influenza (y-axis) for each age category (x-axis).
    % 2. A second kind of graph we want to extract from these data would show us, for a given age category
    % (parameter), what is the mortality by influenza (y-axis) at each time point (x-axis).
    % 3. A third kind of graph we want to extract from these data would show us, for people born in a given
    % year (parameter), what is the mortality by influenza (y-axis) at each age (x-axis).
    % Plot one graph of each category. Do not forget to label the axes of your plot, add a legend, ...
