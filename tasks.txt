B. Functions and algorithms
1. Documentation: functions.
2. Write a MATLAB function m2sum that takes two numbers and returns their sum.
3. Write a MATLAB function pw that asks two numbers as input and raises the first number to
the second one.
4. Write a MATLAB function that takes an integer n and displays n time “hello”. Documentation:
for, disp.
5. Write a MATLAB function that takes a vector of length n (with n > 50) and plots the square
root of all elements.
6. Write a MATLAB function sequence0 that takes an integer n and returns the nth element of the
sequence (u n ) defined by:
• u0 = 0
• u n+1 = 2*cos(u n ) + 1
7. Write a MATLAB function sequence1 that takes an integer n and returns the nth element of the
sequence (u n ) defined by:
• u0 = 1
• u n+1 = u n + n 2 − 4
8. Write a MATLAB function sequence2 that does the same thing for the sequence defined by:
• u0 = 8
• u n+1 =u n /4 if u n is even, 2∗u n +1 otherwise. 10. Write a MATLAB function pra1 that takes three numbers and returns the “middle” one (the
one that is nor the highest nor the lowest).
11. Write a MATLAB function pra2 that takes three numbers and returns the product of the two
lowest numbers.
12. Write a MATLAB function pra3 that takes five numbers and returns 0 if at least two of the
numbers are equals, 1 otherwise.
C. More advanced algorithms
1. Write a MATLAB function mgcd that takes two integers and returns their greater common
divider. Documentation: while.
2. Write a MATLAB function misprime that takes a positive integer and tells whether it is a
prime number. Documentation: sqrt, floor, break.
3. Calculate the sum of the first 500 prime integers.
